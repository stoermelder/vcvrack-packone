# stoermelder AFFIX and µAFFIX

AFFIX and µAFFIX are utility modules for polyphonic cables: They allow you to add an voltage offset to each of the 16 and 8 channels, respectively, by adjusting a knob.

To make the modules more useful the knobs offer three different modes available on the context menu: "Volt" allows the knobs to be set to an exact voltage, "Semitones" snaps the offset in semitone steps according to the 1V/Oct-standard (1/12V per step) and "Octave" snaps the offset in 1V increments.

The modules can be used to adjust the number of active channels within a polyphonic cable or even without an incoming signal at all: Just set the number of channels on the context menu. When set to "Auto" they output the same number of channels as received on the input port.
