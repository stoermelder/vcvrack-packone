# stoermelder INFIX

A module for inserting or replacing channels in a polyphonic cable. By default the module sends the POLY input without change to the POLY output. As soon as a cable is connected to one of the monophonic input ports 1-16 the channel on POLY output gets replaced (in case it is used by POLY input) or added (in case of an unsed channel).
